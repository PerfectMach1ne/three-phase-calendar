We are going to break down the problem into steps:

1. **Data Structure**: We have events (tasks and timeblocks) that we want to display on a weekly calendar view.
2. **Rendering Strategy**: We will use absolute positioning within a grid to place events at the correct time and day.
3. **Handling Long Events**: Events that span multiple days or hours will be handled by adjusting their width and position accordingly.

Approach:
- The calendar is structured as a grid of hours (rows) and days (columns).
- Each day column is identified by a unique ID (like `Mon0`, `Tue1`, etc.) and each hour row is identified by an hour (like `00:00`, `01:00`, etc.).
- We will create a component for each event that will be absolutely positioned within the grid.

Steps:
1. **Calculate the position and dimensions for each event**:
- **Start time**: Convert the event's start time to the hour and minute within the day.
- **End time**: Similarly for the end time.
- **Day of the week**: Determine which column (day) the event starts on.
- For multi-day events, we will break them into segments per day.

2. **Rendering**:
- We will use CSS grid for the main calendar layout.
- Each event will be an absolutely positioned element inside a relative container that spans the entire grid area.

3. **Performance**:
- We will use Vue's reactivity to update events when the week changes.
- We can use a computed property to filter events for the current week.

Implementation:

Step 1: Prepare the events data.
We assume we have a composable `useEvents` that returns events for the current week.

Step 2: Structure the calendar:
We have a grid with:

- 24 rows (one per hour)
- 7 columns (one per day of the week)

Step 3: For each event, calculate:
- `gridColumn`: The day column index (e.g., Monday is 1, Tuesday is 2, etc.)
- `gridRowStart`: The row corresponding to the start hour and minute.
- `gridRowEnd`: The row corresponding to the end hour and minute.

However, note that absolute positioning might be easier in a grid that is set to `position: relative` and then each event is positioned absolutely by:
- `top`: calculated as (start hour * hour height) + (start minute * minute height)
- `left`: (day index) * (column width)
- `height`: (duration in minutes) * (minute height)
- `width`: column width

But note: if an event spans multiple days, we will need to break it into one event per day.
Alternatively, we can handle multi-day events by:
- Breaking the event into one segment per day it spans.
- Each segment is rendered in the corresponding day column.

Step 4: Create an event component.
We can create a component `CalendarEvent` that takes an event (or a segment of an event) and computes its style.
Example style for an event:

```css
.calendar-event {
  position: absolute;
  top: [start pixel];
  left: [day index * column width];
  height: [duration in pixels];
  width: [column width];
  background: [color];
}
```

Step 5: Place the events in the calendar.
We will have a container that covers the entire calendar grid (same as the grid area) and is `position: relative`. Then we place the events as absolute children.

Step 6: Handle week change.
When the week changes, we refetch events for that week and re-render.
Let's code a basic example:

In `BigCalendar.vue`:
```vue
<template>
  <div class="calendar-container">
    <!-- ... existing grid structure ... -->
    <!-- Event container: relative to the grid, same size as the grid -->
    <div class="events-container">
      <CalendarEvent
      v-for="event in eventsForWeek"
      :key="event.id"
      :event="event"
      />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { computed } from 'vue';
import { useEvents } from '../composables/events';
import CalendarEvent from './CalendarEvent.vue';
const { events } = useEvents();
const eventsForWeek = computed(() => {
// Filter events to current week and break multi-day events into segments
return processEvents(events.value);
});
function processEvents(events) {
// This function should:
//   - Filter events that occur in the current week
//   - Break multi-day events into one event per day segment (if they span multiple days)
//   - For each segment, calculate the start and end time for that day
//   - Return an array of event segments
}
</script>

<style>
.calendar-container {
  position: relative;
}
.events-container {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  pointer-events: none; /* Allow clicks to pass through to the grid */
}
.calendar-event {
  position: absolute;
  pointer-events: auto; /* Make the event itself clickable */
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: 4px;
  background-color: #e0e0e0;
  border-left: 4px solid #42b983;
  overflow: hidden;
}
</style>
```

In `CalendarEvent.vue`:
```vue
<script setup>
import { computed } from 'vue';

const props = defineProps({
  event: Object
});

const style = computed(() => {
  // Calculate top, left, height, width
  const hourHeight = 60; // if each hour row is 60px tall
  const dayWidth = 100 / 7; // 7 days, as percentage
  // Calculate top: from the start time in minutes from the top of the day
  const startMinutes = props.event.start.getHours() * 60 + props.event.start.getMinutes();
  const top = (startMinutes / 60) * hourHeight; // in pixels
  // Calculate height: duration in minutes
  const endMinutes = props.event.end.getHours() * 60 + props.event.end.getMinutes();
  const durationMinutes = endMinutes - startMinutes;
  const height = (durationMinutes / 60) * hourHeight;
  // Calculate left: day index (0-6) * dayWidth (%)
  const left = props.event.dayIndex * dayWidth; // in percentage
  return {
    top: `${top}px`,
    left: `${left}%`,
    height: `${height}px`,
    width: `${dayWidth}%`,
  };
});
</script>

<template>
  <div class="calendar-event" :style="style">
    {{ event.name }}
  </div>
</template>

```
Note: This is a simplified version. We must account for:
- Events that start before the current week or end after: we only show the segment in the current week.
- Events that span multiple days: we break them and each segment is an event for that day.
For multi-day events:
```javascript
function processEvents(events) {
  const segments = [];
  events.forEach(event => {
    // If the event spans multiple days, break it
    const startDate = new Date(event.start_datetime);
    const endDate = new Date(event.end_datetime);
    // For each day in the event from start to end (within the current week)
    let current = new Date(startDate);
    while (current <= endDate) {
      // Check if current day is in the current week
      // ...
      const segment = {
        ...event,
        id: `${event.id}-${current.getDay()}`,
        dayIndex: current.getDay(), // 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.
        start: new Date(current), // start of the segment: if it's the first day, use original start time; otherwise, 00:00
        end: new Date(current) // end of the segment: if it's the last day, use original end time; otherwise, 23:59
      };
      // Adjust the start and end for the segment
      if (current.getDate() === startDate.getDate()) {
        segment.start = startDate;
      } else {
        segment.start.setHours(0,0,0,0);
      }
      if (current.getDate() === endDate.getDate()) {
        segment.end = endDate;
      } else {
        segment.end.setHours(23,59,59,999);
      }

      segments.push(segment);
      current.setDate(current.getDate() + 1);
      current.setHours(0,0,0,0);
    }
  });

  return segments;
}
```

This is a complex task, but breaking it down step by step will help.
